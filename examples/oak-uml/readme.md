**Standardized Modeling, Reimagined for Performance** — A high-performance, incremental Unified Modeling Language (UML) semantic model built on the Oak framework. Optimized for large-scale system design, automated modeling toolchains, and intelligent architectural analysis.

## 🎯 Project Vision

UML remains the industry standard for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting software systems. `oak-uml` provides a modern, Rust-powered semantic infrastructure for working with UML models with extreme efficiency. By leveraging Oak's incremental parsing and modeling capabilities, it enables the creation of highly responsive design tools that can analyze and validate massive system models in real-time. Our goal is to provide the most robust and efficient foundation for the next generation of UML-powered developer and architect tools.

## ✨ Core Features

- **⚡ Blazing Fast**: Leverages Rust's performance to provide sub-millisecond semantic analysis for complex UML models.
- **🔄 Incremental by Design**: Built-in support for partial model updates—re-process only the sections that changed.
- **🌳 Semantic AST**: Generates a comprehensive representation capturing the full depth of UML:
    - **Structural Elements**: Precise mapping of classes, interfaces, components, and packages.
    - **Behavioral Elements**: Detailed tracking of use cases, activities, and state machines.
    - **Relationships**: Comprehensive management of associations, dependencies, and realizations.
- **🛡️ Robust Validation**: Engineered to handle incomplete models gracefully and provide precise semantic diagnostics.
- **🧩 Deep Ecosystem Integration**: Seamlessly works with `oak-mermaid`, `oak-plantuml`, and other Oak visualization projects.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The model follows the **Green/Red Tree** architecture (inspired by Roslyn), which allows for:
1. **Efficient Immutability**: Share nodes across different versions of the model without copying.
2. **Lossless Semantic Trees**: Retains all semantic metadata and relationships.
3. **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed "Red" nodes provide a convenient and safe API for model traversal and analysis.
