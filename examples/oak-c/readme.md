**Legacy Performance, Modern Tooling** — A high-performance, incremental C parser built on the Oak framework. Optimized for systems programming, legacy codebase analysis, and real-time developer tooling.

## 🎯 Project Vision

C is the foundation of modern computing, but its aging syntax and complex preprocessor make it a challenge for modern developer tools. `oak-c` provides a robust, high-performance, Rust-powered infrastructure for parsing C that is both accurate and incredibly fast. By utilizing Oak's incremental parsing architecture, we enable the creation of highly responsive IDEs, security analyzers, and refactoring tools that can handle massive C codebases and complex header chains in real-time.

## ✨ Core Features

- **⚡ Blazing Fast**: Leverages Rust's zero-cost abstractions to deliver sub-millisecond parsing, essential for real-time feedback in systems-level development.
- **🔄 Incremental by Design**: Built-in support for partial updates—re-parse only the sections of the C file that changed. Ideal for large-scale source files and complex build systems.
- **🌳 High-Fidelity AST**: Generates a comprehensive Abstract Syntax Tree capturing the full depth of C:
    - **Declarations & Definitions**: Precise mapping of variables, functions, structs, unions, and enums.
    - **Expressions & Statements**: Full support for C's complex operator precedence and control flow.
    - **Preprocessor Awareness**: Robust handling of directives and macro definitions.
    - **Comments & Formatting**: Retains all trivia, enabling faithful round-trip processing and refactoring.
- **🛡️ Industrial-Grade Fault Tolerance**: Engineered to recover from syntax errors gracefully, providing precise diagnostics—crucial for maintaining a smooth developer experience when editing complex C code.
- **🧩 Deep Ecosystem Integration**: Seamlessly works with `oak-lsp` for full LSP support and `oak-mcp` for intelligent code structure discovery.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The parser follows the **Green/Red Tree** architecture (inspired by Roslyn), which allows for:
1. **Efficient Immutability**: Share nodes across different versions of the tree without copying.
2. **Lossless Syntax Trees**: Retains all trivia (whitespace and comments), enabling faithful code formatting and refactoring.
3. **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed "Red" nodes provide a convenient and safe API for tree traversal and analysis.
