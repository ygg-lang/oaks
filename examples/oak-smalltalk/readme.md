**Making SMALLTALK processing simple** — A high-performance, incremental SMALLTALK parser built on the Oak framework.

## 🎯 Project Vision

`oak-smalltalk` is dedicated to providing industrial-grade parsing support for the SMALLTALK language. By leveraging Rust's high-performance characteristics and Oak's incremental parsing architecture, it can easily handle a variety of application scenarios, from simple script analysis to complex IDE language servers.

## ✨ Core Features

- **⚡ Blazing Fast**: Fully utilizes Rust's performance advantages to achieve sub-millisecond parsing response times.
- **🔄 Incremental Parsing**: Built-in support for partial updates, demonstrating extremely high efficiency when processing large files.
- **🌳 Structured Output**: Provides a clear, easy-to-traverse syntax tree or data structure.
- **🛡️ Robustness**: Features a comprehensive error recovery mechanism, ensuring normal operation even when input is incomplete.
- **🧩 Easy Integration**: Designed with high cohesion and low coupling, allowing for quick integration into existing Rust projects.
