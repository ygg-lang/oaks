**Expressivity Meets Efficiency** — A high-performance, incremental Raku (formerly Perl 6) parser built on the Oak framework. Optimized for advanced concurrency, grammar-driven programming, and modern IDE support for the Raku language.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Raku is a highly expressive and multi-paradigm programming language, designed for the next hundred years. `oak-raku` brings modern parsing infrastructure to this powerful language, providing a high-performance, Rust-powered foundation for analysis and tooling. By utilizing Oak's incremental parsing capabilities, it enables the creation of highly responsive developer tools that can handle Raku's unique and complex grammar in real-time. Whether you are building sophisticated linters, automated refactoring tools, or feature-rich IDE extensions, `oak-raku` provides the robust, efficient foundation required for the Raku ecosystem.

## ✨ Core Features

- **⚡ Blazing Fast**: Leverages Rust's performance and memory safety to provide sub-millisecond parsing for complex Raku syntax.
- **🔄 Incremental by Nature**: Built-in support for partial updates—re-parse only what has changed. Essential for large-scale Raku projects.
- **🌳 High-Fidelity AST**: Generates a clean and easy-to-traverse Abstract Syntax Tree capturing:
    - **Grammars & Regex**: First-class support for Raku's powerful grammar and regex systems.
    - **Concurrency & Junctions**: Precise mapping of Raku's unique concurrency constructs and junctions.
    - **Types & Signatures**: Detailed tracking of Raku's expressive type system and function signatures.
    - **Multi-dispatch**: Robust handling of multi-methods and multi-subs.
- **🛡️ Robust Error Recovery**: Engineered to handle incomplete or malformed code gracefully, providing precise diagnostics—crucial for a smooth developer experience.
- **🧩 Deep Ecosystem Integration**: Seamlessly works with `oak-lsp` for full LSP support and `oak-mcp` for Model Context Protocol capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The parser follows the **Green/Red Tree** architecture (inspired by Roslyn), which allows for:
1. **Efficient Immutability**: Share nodes across different versions of the tree without copying.
2. **Lossless Syntax Trees**: Retains all trivia (whitespace and comments), enabling faithful code formatting and refactoring.
3. **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed "Red" nodes provide a convenient and safe API for tree traversal and analysis.
