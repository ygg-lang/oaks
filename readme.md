# Oaks - Parser Framework for Rust

[![Rust Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-nightly-blue.svg)](https://www.rust-lang.org)

Oaks is a modular parser framework for Rust that provides a unified approach to building language parsers. Built on the `oak-core` foundation, Oaks offers a comprehensive set of tools for lexical analysis, parsing, and syntax tree manipulation.

## 🌟 Why Oaks?

Oaks is designed for developers who need more than what parser generators can offer. Our philosophy focuses on three core pillars:

- **Hand-written Optimization**: Unlike generic parser generators, Oaks encourages hand-written parsing logic. This gives you absolute control over the parsing process, allowing for micro-optimizations that generators often miss.
- **Language-Specific Acceleration**: Every language has its own quirks. Oaks provides the infrastructure to leverage language-specific features for maximum performance, ensuring that your parser is as fast as possible for its specific domain.
- **Human-Centric Design**: We believe parsers should be easy to debug and use. Oaks produces highly readable syntax trees and provides clear, actionable error messages that help developers identify and fix issues instantly.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Decouples the core parsing engine from language-specific logic. Implement new languages by defining `TokenType` and `ElementType` without touching the core infrastructure.
- **Lossless Green/Red Tree**: Implements a Rowan-style architecture. **Green Trees** are immutable and interned for memory efficiency, while **Red Trees** provide a parent-aware, position-aware view for effortless traversal.
- **Structural Sharing**: Modifications to the tree use `Arc`-based sharing. Only the modified nodes and their direct ancestors are recreated, making transformations and refactorings extremely memory-efficient.
- **Error Recovery**: The parser can recover from syntax errors to produce a partial but valid tree, ensuring that features like highlighting and autocompletion remain functional during active editing.
- **Incremental Parsing**: By utilizing an `IncrementalCache`, the framework only re-parses the changed portions of the source code, enabling lightning-fast updates for large files in IDE environments.
- **Source Mapping**: Absolute position information is dynamically computed from Red Nodes, providing a stable and accurate foundation for Source Maps and diagnostic reporting.

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities

### Formatter
Implemented by manipulating `Trivia` (whitespace, line breaks, comments) within the `GreenNode` structure. It ensures 100% lossless code formatting by reconstructing the source text while preserving or adjusting non-functional tokens.

### Linter
Utilizes the `Visitor` pattern to traverse the `RedTree`. By leveraging absolute `span` information computed from red nodes, it performs efficient static analysis and provides precise diagnostic locations for coding standard violations.

### Highlighter
Supports dual-mode highlighting: fast Lexer-based highlighting using the raw token stream, and precise Parser-based highlighting that utilizes the full syntax tree to distinguish between semantic categories like function calls, types, and variables.

### Transformer
Powered by the `Transformer` trait, it enables high-performance code refactoring. It leverages the **Structural Sharing** property of the Red-Green tree architecture; only modified nodes and their parent paths are recreated as new `GreenNodes`, while unchanged subtrees are efficiently reused via `Arc`.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

Basic usage example with oak-c:

```rust
use oak_core::{SourceText, Parser};
use oak_c::{CLanguage, CParser};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create source text from input
    let source = SourceText::new("int main() { return 0; }");
    
    // Parse the source code
    let parser = CParser::new(CLanguage::default());
    let result = parser.parse(&source);
    
    // Handle the result
    match result {
        Ok(tree) => println!("Parsed successfully: {:?}", tree),
        Err(errors) => println!("Parse errors: {:?}", errors),
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Oaks is designed from the ground up to be a **High-Performance LSP Foundation**. Its architecture solves the most challenging problems in building modern IDE support:

### The IDE & AI Powerhouse
- **Native LSP & MCP Support**: Built-in support for Language Server Protocol and Model Context Protocol, enabling seamless integration with both modern IDEs and AI agents.
- **Virtual File System (VFS)**: Integrated `oak-vfs` provides a high-performance, incremental file system abstraction, perfect for workspace-wide analysis and cross-file refactorings.
- **Resilient Analysis**: The framework's **Error Recovery** ensures that your analysis tools remain responsive even when the code is in an invalid state.
- **HMR-Ready**: Sub-millisecond **Incremental Parsing** means your tools can provide instant feedback on every keystroke, even in multi-megabyte files.
- **Refactoring Engine**: The `Transformer` trait combined with **Structural Sharing** allows for complex code actions to be implemented with high performance and 100% comment preservation.

### Semantic Integration Ready
While Oaks focuses on high-performance syntax analysis, it is designed to be the perfect foundation for semantic analysis:
- **Semantic Hints**: The `TokenType` and `ElementType` traits provide built-in hooks like `is_definition`, `is_reference`, and `is_scope_boundary`, allowing external semantic engines to instantly understand the tree's logical structure.
- **Stable Identifiers**: Red nodes provide stable pointers that semantic analyzers can use for symbol indexing and cross-referencing.
- **Parent-Aware Navigation**: The `RedTree` allows semantic checkers to easily bubble up from a usage to its scope or declaration.
- **Typed IR**: The high-level **Typed AST** layer serves as a clean, serializable Intermediate Representation (IR) that external type-checkers and symbol solvers can consume without knowing the details of the red-green tree.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Oaks is unopinionated about how you handle semantics, making it trivial to integrate with databases (like Salsa) or graph-based analysis engines.

### Core Framework Concepts
- **Language Trait**: A unified interface to plug in any grammar.
- **Green Tree**: The "What" — immutable, shared, and extremely compact.
- **Red Tree**: The "Where" — a lightweight, parent-aware view for easy tree walking.
- **Visitor & Transformer**: Standardized patterns for both read-only analysis (Linter) and read-write mutations (Refactoring).

### Language Implementations

Each language parser (e.g., `oak-c`, `oak-json`) follows a consistent pattern:

1. **SyntaxKind Enum**: Defines all possible syntax elements
2. **Language Struct**: Implements the Language trait
3. **Lexer Struct**: Implements tokenization for the language
4. **AST Definitions**: Optional typed AST structures
